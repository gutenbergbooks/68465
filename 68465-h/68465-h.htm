  <h2 class='c003'>PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The Author, from the commencement of his study of
the law, and more especially during his course of reading
for the intermediate and final examinations, became convinced
of the very great advantage to be reaped from a
knowledge of the leading Latin Maxims, now so frequently
quoted in all legal works; those given hereafter will
be found to comprise all that occur in the recognised
examination text-books, having been collected from such
works.</p>

<p class='c005'>It will be remembered that a maxim is a general
principle and universally approved leading truth; therefore,
even the most elementary student cannot do better
than store away in his memory some of the more
important of these rules as a foundation for future study.
At every law examination questions are to be found
that bear directly on some one or other of the principles
contained in these maxims, and they are often quoted,
the student being required to translate and explain
their meaning and application—they are, in fact, equally
important with Leading Cases.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>Those maxims only have been selected which are
constantly met with by the student, and which he would
do well to commit to memory; leading cases are also
referred to. The explanations have been made as
brief as possible, and for deeper research the student
is referred to Broom’s Legal Maxims.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>PREFACE TO SECOND AND THIRD EDITIONS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>After a busy and practical experience of many years
the writer can now in all earnestness—as during the
days of studentship he did in all distrust and doubtfulness—emulate
the writer of old who said—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cognitio legis est copulata et complicata.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Our greatest writers of more recent years have also
recognised the intricate and ever-changing study of the
Law. The late Lord Tennyson, in that most beautiful
poem, “Aylmer’s Field,” tells us—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“So Leolin went; and as we task ourselves</div>
      <div class='line'>To learn a language known but smatteringly</div>
      <div class='line'>In phrases here and there at random—toiled</div>
      <div class='line'>Mastering the lawless science of our law,</div>
      <div class='line'>That codeless myriad of precedent,</div>
      <div class='line'>That wilderness of single instances,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thro’ which a few, by wit or fortune led,</div>
      <div class='line'>May beat a pathway out to wealth and fame.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Those who wish to follow successfully the law as a
profession must remain students to the last, and the
leading truths and time-honoured legal principles, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>defined by the maxims hereafter contained, will ever
serve alike as safe landmarks, and sheet anchors, in times
of doubt and uncertainty.</p>

<p class='c005'>Since the publication of the First Edition, the number
of maxims (very properly defined as the condensed good
sense of nations) has been considerably enlarged, but
the student will find the more important ones prefixed
by an asterisk, and these may with advantage be
memorized.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'><span class='large'>A COLLECTION</span> <span class='small'>OF</span> LATIN MAXIMS AND PHRASES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'><strong><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">* 1. A verbis legis non recedendum est.</span></strong> <em>The words of
the law must not be departed from.</em></p>

<p class='c005'>Acts of Parliament must be interpreted strictly according
to the express letters of their respective clauses.
Although in certain cases an equitable construction can
be placed on the words, yet this principle is confined
within certain limits; and a judge cannot, in favour of a
presumable intention, depart from such words when, for
anything that appears, the wording may correspond with
the design of the legislature. (See Steph. Comm.)</p>

<p class='c008'><strong><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">* 2. Accessorium non ducit sed sequitur suum principale.</span></strong>
<em>The accessory does not lead but follows its
principal.</em></p>

<p class='c005'>The grant of a reversion will also include a rent
incident thereto—so heir-looms follow the inheritance.</p>

<p class='c008'><strong><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">3. Accusare nemo se debet, nisi coram Deo.</span></strong> <em>No one
is in duty bound to accuse himself unless before
God.</em></p>

<p class='c005'>In certain cases a witness is not compelled to answer,
if by so doing he would incriminate himself. (See Max.
No. 171.)</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span><strong><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">* 4. Acta exteriora indicant interiora secreta.</span></strong> <em>Overt
acts make known latent thoughts</em>, or <em>Acts indicate
the intention</em>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Where an authority given by law is abused, the person
becomes a trespasser <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ab initio</span></i>, but not so if authority be
given by party, or in cases of mere non-feasance. (<em>Six
Carpenters’ Case</em>, 1 Smith, L. C. 11th ed. p. 132.)</p>

<p class='c008'><strong><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">* 5. Actio personalis moritur cum personâ.</span></strong> <em>A personal
action dies with the person.</em></p>

<p class='c005'>In actions of tort this was formerly a general rule,
but recently its application has been so generally
narrowed that it probably affects only actions for libel
and slander. By Lord Campbell’s Act, 9 &amp; 10 Vict.
c. 93, compensation may, however, now be recovered by
the relatives of a person negligently killed. Compensation
may also be recovered in some cases of trespass.
(See Chitty, 16th ed. p. 347.)</p>

<p class='c008'><strong><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">6. Actus curiae neminem gravabit.</span></strong> <em>The act of the
Court shall prejudice no man.</em></p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>Cumber</em> v. <em>Wane</em>, 1 Sm. L. C. 11th ed. p. 338.)</p>

<p class='c008'><strong><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">* 7. Actus Dei nemini facit injuriam.</span></strong> <em>The act of God
causes injury to no one.</em></p>

<p class='c005'>Storms, tempests, and the like, are acts of God, being
inevitable accidents not caused by man.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span><strong><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">8. Actus me invito, non est meus actus.</span></strong> <em>An involuntary
act is not one’s own act</em>, i.e., <em>an act done against one’s
will is not such person’s act</em>.</p>

<p class='c005'>The law presumes coercion in certain cases—by a
husband over his wife. Intentions denominate the
action, and especially so in criminal cases. (See next
Max. and Nos. 116 and 285.)</p>

<p class='c008'><strong><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">* 9. Actus non facit reum, nisi mens sit rea.</span></strong> <em>The act
itself does not make a man guilty, unless his intention
be so.</em></p>

<p class='c005'>There must be a vicious will or criminal intention as
well as an unlawful act. (See Maxs. Nos. 8, 116 and 285.)
Where one engaged in doing a lawful act, without any
wrongful intention, unfortunately and inadvertently kills
another person, the homicide is excusable.</p>

<p class='c008'><strong><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">10. Ad questiones facti non respondent judices; ad
questiones legis non respondent juratores.</span></strong>
<em>Judges do not decide questions of fact; the jury do
not decide questions of law.</em></p>

<p class='c005'>This applies to trials by jury, and where the issue
turns rather upon facts than legal construction, such
method of trial is usually, but not necessarily, followed.</p>

<p class='c008'><strong><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">* 11. Aequitas factum habet quod fieri oportuit.</span></strong>
<em>Equity looks upon that as done which ought to have
been done.</em></p>

<p class='c005'>The doctrine of satisfaction well illustrates this principle
of law. (See Max. No. 74.) Where a person is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>under an obligation to perform an act, equity looks on
it as done, and allows the same results to follow as if
it were actually done. Thus, when one who has contracted
to sell realty dies, the purchase money therefor
forms part of his estate, and goes to his next of kin, if
intestate, such realty being deemed in equity to be vested
in the contractee. (See <em>Fletcher</em> v. <em>Ashburner</em>, 1 Wh. &amp;
Tu. 8th ed. p. 347.)</p>

<p class='c008'><strong><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">12. Aequitas nunquam contravenit leges.</span></strong> <em>Equity never
opposes the law.</em></p>

<p class='c005'>To supplement, and not to contravene, is its object.</p>

<p class='c008'><strong><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">* 13. Aequitas sequitur legem.</span></strong> <em>Equity follows the law.
Equity cannot alter the law of the land, but follows
it.</em></p>

<p class='c005'>Both in the sense of obeying the law, and conforming
to its general rules and policy, and also in applying to
equitable estates and interests the rules by which at
common law legal estates and interests of a similar kind
are governed.</p>

<p class='c008'><strong><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">14. Agentes et consentientes pari poenâ plectentur.</span></strong>
<em>Acting and consenting parties are liable to the same
punishment.</em></p>

<p class='c005'>A person aiding and abetting the actual commission of
a crime, either at the scene of its commission or elsewhere,
is equally liable with the perpetrator, the former
being a principal in the second degree, and the latter in
the first degree. If A., with intent to murder, inflicts on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>B. an injury dangerous to life, aided and abetted by C.,
who is aware of the intent, they are both equally guilty
and punishable.</p>

<p class='c008'><strong><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">* 15. Alienatio rei praefertur juri accrescendi.</span></strong> <em>The
law favours alienation rather than accumulation.</em></p>

<p class='c005'>This maxim has always been the policy of our law,
even from the time when the right of subinfeudation was
first recognised. The statutes of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Donis</span></i>, 13 Edw. I.
c. 1 and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quia emptores</span></i>, 18 Edw. I. c. 1, are examples in
proof of this doctrine. Also the rules against perpetuities,
which forbid any executory interests to take effect later
than a life or lives in being or twenty-one years afterwards,
allowance being made for gestation where the
same actually exists.</p>

<p class='c008'><strong><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">16. Allegans contraria non est audiendus.</span></strong> <em>One who
contradicts himself is not to be heard.</em></p>

<p class='c005'>A rule of evidence relative to the credibility of a
witness. Cross-examination is frequently used to this
end.</p>

<p class='c008'><strong><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">17. Allegans suam turpitudinem non est audiendus.</span></strong>
<em>A person boasting of his own wrong-doing is not to
be heard.</em></p>

<p class='c005'>When a person does an act which may be rightfully
performed, he cannot say that such act was intentionally
done wrongly. See <em>In re Hallett, Knatchbull</em> v.
<em>Hallett</em>, 13 Ch. Div. 696, where an <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">obiter dictum</span></i> found
in the judgment of the Court is as follows: “When
we come to apply that principle” (<em>i.e.</em>, the one given
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>above) “to the case of a trustee who has blended
trust moneys with his own, it seems perfectly plain that
he cannot be heard to say that he took away the trust
money, when he had a right to take away his own
money.”</p>

<p class='c008'><strong><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">* 18. Ambiguitas contra stipulatorem est.</span></strong> <em>An ambiguity
is taken against the party using it.</em></p>

<p class='c005'>Thus, if in a lease, words of exception be used ambiguously,
the same being words of the lessor, are
construed most strongly as against him. (See Chitty on
Contracts, 16th ed. p. 113; also Max. No. 272.)</p>

<p class='c008'><strong><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">* 19. Ambiguitas verborum latens verificatione suppletur;
nam quod ex facto oritur ambiguum
verificatione facti tollitur.</span></strong> <em>A hidden ambiguity
of the words may be interpreted by evidence; for an
ambiguity which arises from an extrinsic fact may
be removed by proof of such fact.</em></p>

<p class='c005'>(See Max. No. 20.)</p>

<p class='c008'><strong><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">* 20. Ambiguitas verborum patens nullâ verificatione
excluditur.</span></strong> <em>A patent ambiguity of the words cannot
be removed by extrinsic evidence.</em></p>

<p class='c005'>The last two maxims are most important in the
construction of contracts. Thus upon a devise, “to one
of the sons of J. S.,” who has several sons, parol
evidence would not be admissible to ascertain which son
in particular was referred to. (Max. No. 19.) But where
there is a devise of “the Manor of A.,” the testator
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>having two estates of that description, this being a latent
ambiguity, parol evidence is admissible to explain which

maxim, and the principle upon which they are founded
is the one therein contained.</p>

<p class='c008'><strong><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">73. Equity never wants a trustee.</span></strong></p>

<p class='c005'>Where a valid trust exists, equity will impose on the

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span><strong><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">* 74. Equity regards the spirit and not the letter.</span></strong></p>

<p class='c005'>Equity looks at the intention of the parties, and not at
the actual words employed in any transaction. Equity
always regarded a mortgage as an instrument to secure
the repayment of money, and allowed the mortgagor to
redeem at any time, but at Common Law, unless the
mortgagor paid back the money by the day named in the
mortgage deed, his right of redemption was gone. (See
Maxs. Nos. 11 and 196.)</p>

<p class='c008'><strong><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">75. Erant omnia communia et indivisa omnibus,
veluti unum cunctis patrimonium esset.</span></strong> <em>All
things were common and undivided to all people, as
if there were one property for all.</em></p>

<p class='c005'>See Justin I. 43, c. 1. While there were yet few inhabitants
on the face of the globe, it seems probable and
reasonable that all things were in common among them,
and that each took from the public stock what he might
require for immediate purposes, and that the right of possession
was coexistent only with actual possession. (See
Steph. Comm. Vol. I. Book II.)</p>

the remedies of the law, and without usurping jurisdiction,
to apply its rules to the advancement of

<p class='c005'>Where a case comes before a court of law, in which it
has hitherto been the practice to refuse relief to the
plaintiff or defendant, as the case may be, and consequently
to drive such party to seek redress in the Court
of Chancery, it is expedient for all parties and the public
at large, that such court of law, and its judge, should act
in a liberal and uncramped manner, and if possible apply
the necessary remedy. (See <em>Collins</em> v. <em>Blantern</em>, 1 Smith,
L. C. 11th ed. p. 369.) By the Judicature Acts, “law”
and “equity” are to be concurrently administered in all

<p class='c005'>The context must be most thoroughly looked into
before a correct interpretation can be obtained. This
maxim is one of the most important rules for the construction
of contracts, which in all cases are to be favourably
construed according to their object, and the whole of their
terms. (See Chitty on Contracts, 16th ed. p. 100, and

<p class='c005'>Every simple contract must be supported by a valuable

the rule “that a sufficient consideration or recompense
for making, or motive or inducement to make, the promise
upon which a party is charged, is of the very essence of a
contract not under seal, both at law and in equity; and
that such consideration must exist, or the promise will be

<p class='c005'>A voluntary courtesy is insufficient to support a subsequent
promise, unless there has been an antecedent

except where the consideration, though executed, is of
such a nature that it must necessarily have been moved
by a previous request, and in which case therefore, such a
statement becomes merely “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">expressio eorum quae tacitè

dwelling-houses and the brewhouse thereunto belonging,”
it was ruled that the fixtures in the other mortgaged

<p class='c005'>A mortgagee can only foreclose those claiming an

mortgagee, in order to obtain the rights of a first

<p class='c005'>When an act has to be done on a certain day, the
whole of that day is allowed in which to do it. This
rule has exceptions, however, for in case of documents
registered on the same day, priority of registration may
be shown by the numbers, and this becomes, at times, of
the utmost importance.</p>

<p class='c005'>This is one of the old laws of inheritance, which are
still of importance as leading to a perfect understanding
of the Act of 1833. Formerly no one could succeed to
an inheritance unless he was not only of the blood of
the purchaser, but also his lineal issue, consequently one
brother could not succeed to another brother’s inheritance,
of which the latter was the purchaser, because he
could not be his brother’s lineal issue, but where the
inheritance had originally descended from an ancestor,
one brother could succeed another, as he might be the
lineal issue of such ancestor. (See Steph. Comm. I.
15th ed. p. 257 <em>et seq.</em>, also next Maxim and No. 203.)</p>

<p class='c005'>Another old law of inheritance, under which the half-blood
were totally excluded, the land escheating to the
lord of the manor rather than go to a kinsman bearing
this relationship to the person from whom descent was
to be traced. Now, however, since the Inheritance Act,
s. 9, it is otherwise, the place in which any such relation
by the half-blood stands in the order of inheritance being
next after any relative in the same degree of the whole
blood, and his issue, where the common ancestor is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>male, and next after the common ancestor, where such
common ancestor is a female. (See Steph. Comm. I.

<p class='c005'>This illustrates the doctrine of constructive frauds.
Where a man designedly produces a false impression on
another, and the latter consequently commits some act,
or enters into some contract, injurious to himself and his
own interests, the former is guilty of fraud. (See Max.

<em>That is unnecessarily done by many (words), which is

<p class='c005'>That the force of this maxim has been appreciated by
our legislature is shown and evidenced by most of the
recent Acts of Parliament, and especially so by the
Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, 1881, which has
considerably curtailed the length of many legal documents.

by which, on failure of issue of the purchaser, the inheritance
goes to the nearest lineal ancestor. Bracton and
Lord Coke compared the descent of an inheritance to
that of a falling body, which never went upwards in its
course. “Descendit jus quasi ponderosum quid, cadens

a deed purporting to be a release which could not

act within the scope of his authority. In <em>Scott</em> v.

<p class='c005'>So one who enables another to commit a fraud is
answerable. A person who has a title to property offered
for sale at an auction, and, knowing his title, stands by
and encourages the sale or does not forbid it, will be
bound by the sale, for “<em>Qui non obstat quod obstare

and if there has been some contrivance or inducement to
allure the party into drink, or any unfair advantage
taken of his intoxication, the Court will sometimes
relieve. (But see Chitty on Contracts, 16th ed. pp. 161–162.)</p>

who claims under a lease from the mortgagor, granted

The rule stated in this maxim applies as between finders
of “treasure trove,” derelicts, and such like. (See also
<em>Keech</em> v. <em>Hall</em>, 1 Sm. L. C. 11th ed. p. 511.) Where
several persons have interests in the same property, and
equal equities in every point except time, as in the case
of a third mortgagee who had no notice of a second
mortgage when making his advance, here both mortgagees
have equal equities, but the second mortgagee,
being first in point of time, has the prior right. In this
instance, however, the third mortgagee could avail
himself of the advantages of tacking. (See Max. No.

Thus a bill of sale which purported to assign to R. “all

mentioned and set forth in an inventory or schedule of

goods specified in the inventory which did not comprise
all the goods in the house. In construing a statute
general words must not be extended unduly. (See

understood in their plain, ordinary, and popular sense,
unless they may by custom of trade or the like have
acquired a peculiar or technical sense and meaning. The
“golden rule” as regards Acts of Parliament is that the
words must be construed in their plain and grammatical

The misrepresentation must be material, and the party

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&#8482; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

<div style='display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold'>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
